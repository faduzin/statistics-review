## Introduction
This document serves as a structured review of key statistical concepts essential for data analysis and data science. Each section will be filled with notes, definitions, examples, and insights as I progress through my studies. The goal is to build a strong foundation in statistics to enhance analytical and problem-solving skills.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Statistics

#### What is Statistics?
- **Data** is the raw material of knowledge.
- **Statistics** is a set of tools used to calculate, summarize, and understand data.
- Statistics helps process data, ranging from trivial cases (e.g., sports statistics) to profound insights (e.g., the Gini index, which measures income inequality).
- It is one of the most powerful tools for transforming information into meaningful conclusions.

#### The Role and Limitations of Statistics
- **Descriptive statistics** exist to simplify data, but simplification always implies some loss of nuance or detail.
- Overreliance on any single descriptive statistic can lead to misleading conclusions.
- Statistics are present in every profession and are applied in various fields, such as research, finance, polling, healthcare, and technology.

### 2. Populations, Samples, and Statistical Inference

#### Key Definitions
- **Population**: The entire set of individuals or elements under study, defined by specific rules or filters.
- **Sample**: A subset of the population selected for analysis.
- **Inference**: The process of using sample data to draw conclusions about the population.

#### The Importance of Sampling
- In most cases, studying the entire population is impractical or impossible.
- **Random Sampling**: A sampling method where all members of the population have an equal chance of being selected.
- A sample should be **representative** and **unbiased** to provide accurate inferences.
- However, it is impossible to absolutely guarantee that a selected sample is perfectly representative or free of bias.

#### Parameters vs. Estimators
- **True Value (Parameter)**: The actual value that describes a characteristic of the population.
- **Estimated Value (Estimator)**: The value calculated from the sample, which serves as an approximation of the parameter.

#### Trust in Statistical Inference
- **Confidence (Trust) is never 100%**, as there is always uncertainty in sampling.
- Confidence levels express the probability that the chosen sample accurately represents the population.
