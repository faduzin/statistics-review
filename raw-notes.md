# Raw Notes

## 06/03

- Data is the raw material of knowledge.
- Statistics help us process data, and sometimes the data is trivial, like sports statistics, other times the data offers insights into the nature of human existence, like the Gini index.
- Statistics is the most powerful tool we have for using information to a meaninful end.
- Overreliance in any descriptive statistic can lead to misleading conclusions.
- Desctriptive statistics exist to simplify data, which always implies some loss of nuance or detail.
- Statistics is a set of tools used to calculate, summarize and understand data.
- Data can be about different things, such as people, experiments, finances, systems, researches, polling and many other sources.
- Statistics are present in any profession.
- Statistics is a sumary of the data.
- Population is the rules or filters related to the general data studied.
- Sample is a part of the population.
- Inference is the use of samples to find something about the population.
- When population is available, which is not the usual, the selection of samples is extremely relevant, as the sample should be representative and non biased.
- Random sampling -> all components of the population have the same chance to be a part of the sample
- True value = parameter
- Estimated value = estimator
- There is no way to absolutely guarantee that you choose a representative, non biased sample.
- Trust is a value that is never 100 and represents the chances of a representative, non biased sample, being chosen.

### Corrections

- Population is the entire set of individuals or elements under study, defined by specific rules or filters.
- The metric is not trust but confidence, and a better definition is that confidence is never 100%, as there is always uncertainty in sampling. Confidence levels express the probability that the chosen sample accurately represents the population.
- Inference is the process of using sample data to draw conclusions about the population.
