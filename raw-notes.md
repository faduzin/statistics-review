# Raw Notes

## 06/03

- Data is the raw material of knowledge.
- Statistics help us process data, and sometimes the data is trivial, like sports statistics, other times the data offers insights into the nature of human existence, like the Gini index.
- Statistics is the most powerful tool we have for using information to a meaninful end.
- Overreliance in any descriptive statistic can lead to misleading conclusions.
- Desctriptive statistics exist to simplify data, which always implies some loss of nuance or detail.
- Statistics is a set of tools used to calculate, summarize and understand data.
- Data can be about different things, such as people, experiments, finances, systems, researches, polling and many other sources.
- Statistics are present in any profession.
- Statistics is a sumary of the data.
- Population is the rules or filters related to the general data studied.
- Sample is a part of the population.
- Inference is the use of samples to find something about the population.
- When population is available, which is not the usual, the selection of samples is extremely relevant, as the sample should be representative and non biased.
- Random sampling -> all components of the population have the same chance to be a part of the sample
- True value = parameter
- Estimated value = estimator
- There is no way to absolutely guarantee that you choose a representative, non biased sample.
- Trust is a value that is never 100 and represents the chances of a representative, non biased sample, being chosen.

### Corrections

- Population is the entire set of individuals or elements under study, defined by specific rules or filters.
- The metric is not trust but confidence, and a better definition is that confidence is never 100%, as there is always uncertainty in sampling. Confidence levels express the probability that the chosen sample accurately represents the population.
- Inference is the process of using sample data to draw conclusions about the population.

- The formula to calculate **variance** is the sum of the squared differences between each term and the mean, divided by the number of terms.
- The formula for standard deviation is the square root of the **variance**.
- Most phenomena can be described in multiple ways, and when there are several possible descriptions, the choice of descriptive statistics profoundly impacts the impression conveyed.
- If the motivation behind presenting data is not honest, perfectly valid facts can still be used to support entirely disputable or illegitimate conclusions.
- There is a crucial distinction between **precision** and **accuracy**:
  - **Precision** is the exactness or detail with which we can express something.
  - **Accuracy** is how close a measurement or result is to the true or correct value.
- An answer can be precise if it specifies an exact result, yet inaccurate if it does not reflect the true value or points in the wrong direction.
- An answer can also be accurate (generally correct) but imprecise if it lacks detail or exactness.
- Precision can mask inaccuracy by giving a false sense of certainty.
- Even the most precise measurements or calculations should be checked against common sense.
- Even the most precise and accurate descriptive statistics can suffer from a fundamental issue: the lack of clarity about what exactly is being defined, described, or explained.
- The **unit of analysis** is the entity being studied, compared, or described by statistics.
- The **mean** and **median** are both measures of central tendency:
  - **Mean** is the arithmetic average (the sum of values divided by the number of values).
  - **Median** is the midpoint of the distribution (the value separating the upper half from the lower half of the data).
- What does the discrepancy between median and mean indicate about the distribution?

### Corrections made:

- **"Variation"** was replaced with **"variance"**, as it is the accurate statistical term.
- Corrected the definitions of **precision** and **accuracy** for clarity and accuracy.
- Clarified the statement **"The same is true if inverted"** by explicitly stating the inverted scenario (accurate but imprecise).
- Clearly defined **mean** as "arithmetic average".
- Clearly defined **median** as the midpoint separating the data into two equal halves.
- Improved grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure throughout.
- Reformulated the final question **"What does the discrepancy between median and mean tells?"** to a clearer and grammatically correct version: **"What does the discrepancy between median and mean indicate about the distribution?"**
